# cards-assistant

This is an alpha version of a steam trading card trading assistant. Wow, that's a mouthful.

## Goal

The concept is simple, check the games the trading partner has badges for, check all uncrafted sets you have in your inventory,
and then output the sets that you have, but the partner doesn't.

## v0.3

This is not working currently, it's missing a vital building block.
