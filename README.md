# cards-assistant

This is an alpha version of a steam trading card trading assistant. Wow, that's a mouthful.

## Goal

The concept is simple, check the games the trading partner has badges for, check all uncrafted sets you have in your inventory,
and then output the sets that you have, but the partner doesn't.

## Status

As of __0.4__, this application *should be* functional.

I have not been able to test 0.4 very extensively yet, so expect bugs and maybe even occasional crashes.
Older components have already been tested, and are considered stable.
